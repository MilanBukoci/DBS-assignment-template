## Build

Requires `pdflatex` and `bibtex` (TeX Live, MiKTeX, or MacTeX).

```bash
make          # build src/main.pdf
make clean    # remove build artifacts
```

Or upload `src/` and `assets/` to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

## Language

Switch language by changing one line in `main.tex`:

```latex
\input{lang/en}    % English
\input{lang/sk}    % Slovak
```

To add a new language, copy `lang/en.tex`, translate the `\newcommand` values, and `\input` your file.

## Bibliography

Add entries to `src/references.bib` and cite them in text with `\cite{key}`:

```latex
According to the documentation \cite{postgresql-docs}, ...
```

The bibliography is rendered automatically at the end of the document via `\printbibliography`.

## CI/CD

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that **automatically builds the PDF** on every push to `master`.
No local LaTeX installation needed — just push and download the result.

The built PDF is available as an artifact in the **Actions** tab of your repository:

> Repository → Actions → latest run → Artifacts → `assignment`

This means you can edit `main.tex` directly on GitHub (or via Codespaces), push, and pick up the compiled PDF without 
ever installing LaTeX locally.

The workflow lives in `.github/workflows/build.yml` and uses
[`xu-cheng/latex-action`](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action) — a full TeX Live environment that handles all
the `pdflatex`/`bibtex` passes automatically.

## How to use

1. Open `src/main.tex`
2. Set your language (`lang/en` or `lang/sk`)
3. Fill in student details:
   ```latex
   \newcommand{\StudentName}{Name Surname}
   \newcommand{\StudyGroup}{Tuesday 11:00}
   \newcommand{\AssignmentNumber}{1}
   \newcommand{\AssignmentTitle}{Assignment Title}
   \newcommand{\AcademicYear}{2025/2026}
   ```
4. Add sections as needed:
   ```latex
   \section{Your Section Title}

   Your content here.
   ```
5. Add references to `references.bib`
6. Run `make` and submit the PDF
